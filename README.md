Design pattern is preferable to any languages, understand the concepts and scenarios you could implement it in any Object Oriented Programming Language.

## Note:
* Abstraction is a very good way to implement functions/classes, however they (sometimes) will not be neccessary in Python, thanks for it dynamic-typed. Function may not know about about its' parameters until they're called during runtime which also can be consider as 'abstract'.
